# Tinto

Tinto is a mobile-friendly website that will help you write down the wines that would definitely drink again, and wines that you'd rather give to your worst enemy.

With the power of **Appwrite** and **Vercel**, Tinto brings a Material Design (v2) based interface to store different lists of wines for the user and show statistics of the most liked wines from the community. Making sure you always have the information that you need for that special moment with your glass of wine.
